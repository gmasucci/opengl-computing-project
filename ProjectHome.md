Our project is to design and build a working technical demo using openGL. The demo will be able to run on any Windows XP or above machine with openGL 3.0 or higher and will not use any deprecated openGL features.

The final product will be an example of what can be achieved with the newer openGL revisions and will be released under a GNU GPL v3.0 or similar licence.
